 * tag and the draft, build-binaries has uploaded all six assets, and build-docker
 * has pushed `:latest` and `:<version>` to Docker Hub. The MSI job fails,
 * finalize-release is skipped, and cleanup-on-failure deliberately does not fire
 * - leaving `:latest` on Docker Hub silently replaced by a release candidate,
 * which is the part no rollback here undoes.
 *
 * Latent rather than live: every tag in the repo is plain three-part semver, so
 * this waits for the first time someone types a suffixed version. The fix is to
 * refuse it at the step before anything has been published.
